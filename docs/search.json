I do actuarial investigations, triangulation and IFRS 17 reporting, among other things. I received a bachelor’s degree in actuarial science from Strathmore University in 2023.\nBesides, I procrastinate by reading books and research papers, learning R and Rust, and gaming. My favourite past time is writing R code/packages, particularly showcasing that R is in fact a fully-fledged programming language and can be used for production grade software; it is kind of “spite-driven development”. I like my code clean and blazing fast. Lately, I have had a fascination wth Rust and what you can do with it in conjunction with R as the glue language."
