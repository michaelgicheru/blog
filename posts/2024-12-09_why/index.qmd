  I have decided to start a blog, as a place to share and rant (sometimes) on stuff I care about. Here are some thoughts on what I want to achieve.

The time has come to create a personal blog, after some encouragement from my partner who thinks my views are worth sharing with the Internet (and who I suspect has grown tired of my occasional rants on code and work). I confess I have been interested in starting one given my love for reading blogs on #rstats, sports and business topics, among others. I finally got some time off work to finally start one.

That being said, I have a couple of goals with starting this blog:

- **Sharing code**: I will be sharing code that I find interesting or useful, particularly packages or code that I come up with for work or my daily life. This will be mostly R and Rust code, relating to actuarial science and data science.

- **Communicating my philosophies**: This includes but not limited to my thoughts on open source software, my love for walkable cities and occasionally, my belief that every human being deserves to be treated with kindness and sympathy, maybe even my faith. I think everyone should be able to air their views on the world or what they love, and the Internet is a wonderful tool for this. So this is me doing what I believe in.

- **Improving my communication skills**: This blog will be largely very technical. I am an actuary in my day job and most of my posts will revolve around this, and how I use R to do my work. I want to be able to communicate concepts and my thought processes as best as I can and hopefully improve on them.

- **Pushing the boundaries of R and recently Rust**: I want to learn as much as I can about R and Rust and communicate what I learn with the actuarial and data science community. I want to see what use cases and potential these languages have, for communities I consider myself to be part of. 

Yeah, that's it, I think. In advance, thank you for reading.
