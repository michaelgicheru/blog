Hello there! I am Michael Gicheru, welcome to my blog. I'm a part-qualified actuary and music lover. I believe in all things open source. I believe in walkable cities. I have an irrational love for R, and are currently learning Rust. 

I have a Bachelor's degree in Actuarial Science from [Strathmore University](https://strathmore.edu/). I am currently an Actuarial Associate at [Britam](https://britam.com/), supporting the Non-Life subsidiary. My work includes calculating base estimate reserves, financial reporting, conducting experience reviews, pricing, asset-liability matching exercises and reinsurance reviews. I particularly enjoy automating my daily tasks in R. 

I try to talk about any interesting projects I have worked on or software I have stumbled upon on this blog; especially if it has a use case in actuarial science.
